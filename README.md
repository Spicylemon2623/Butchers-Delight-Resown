Butcher's Delight: Resown is a Fabric port of [Butcher's Delight: Rechopped](https://github.com/TakeruDavis/Butchers-Delight-Rechopped), a spiritual successor to the mod [Butcher's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/butchers-delight). This mod features an entirely new way to manage meats, featuring a fully [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) mod compatible butchering system, several new machines and tools, and many mechanics to dive into that make animals more interesting and realistic to manage.

Planned Updates: <br>
\- 1.0: Complete reimplementation of the original mod 1:1 <br>
\- 1.1: Make a separate addon for [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) compatibility <br>
\- 1.2: Retexturing and remodelling of everything <br>

Future Concepts (could be implemented when the base mod is finished): <br>
\- Increased realism (while maintaining simplicity) for the [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) addon <br>
\- Blood draining and other byproducts that must be managed (Like what do you do with cow eyeballs?) <br>
\- Slightly more realistic animal behaviour like running away (instead of running around) and attacking back randomly
