Butcher's Delight: Resown is a spiritual successor to the mod [Butcher's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/butchers-delight). This mod features an entirely new way to manage meats, a full Create mod compatible butchering system, several new machines and tools, and many mechanics to dive into that make animals more interesting and realistic to manage.
There is a forge version of this mod linked [here](https://github.com/TakeruDavis/Butchers-Delight-Rechopped).

Planned Updates: <br>
    \- 1.0: Complete reimplementation of the original mod 1:1 <br>
    \- 1.1: Retexturing and remodeling of everything, bugfixing, and adding configs<br>
    \- 1.2: Compat with other mods and addition of a small addon api <br>
    \- 1.3: Make a seperate addon for [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) compatibility <br>

Future Concepts (may be implemented when the base mod is finished): <br>
    \- Blood draining (on dirt, grass, or a new drain block) <br>
    \- Wall plaques (as an alternative to the cow skull but for every animal) <br>
    \- More to come! <br>
